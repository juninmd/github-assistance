## Development Instructions

### Phase 1: Design with Stitch
1. Use MCP Stitch to rapidly prototype UI improvements
2. Generate interactive mockups for new/updated components
3. Iterate on designs based on best practices:
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Performance (lazy loading, optimized assets)
   - Modern design patterns

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Convert Stitch prototypes into production-ready components
2. Use appropriate framework (React/Vue/Angular based on project)
3. Implement with TypeScript for type safety
4. Follow project's existing design system or create one if missing
5. Add comprehensive component documentation
6. Include unit tests for all components

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Ensure all components are accessible:
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
2. Optimize performance:
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Image optimization
3. Add Storybook/component showcase if not present

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Update/Create DESIGN.md with:
   - Component library overview
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Usage examples
   - Accessibility guidelines
2. Add inline JSDoc comments
3. Create README for component folder if needed

## Success Criteria
- All UI improvements implemented and tested
- Accessibility score of 95+ on Lighthouse
- Performance score of 90+ on Lighthouse
- Clear documentation for future developers
- PR with screenshots/videos of changes

Create a PR with all improvements and detailed description.
